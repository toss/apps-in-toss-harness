/**
 * Runner-agnostic report serialisation for env3 test runs (devtools#696).
 *
 * Both env3 execution paths — the Vitest custom pool (`pool.ts`) and the
 * standalone `devtools-test` CLI (`cli.ts`) — call the same core
 * `runTestFilesOverRelay` and so produce the same {@link RelayRunReport}. This
 * module is the single, runner-neutral place that turns that in-memory report
 * into a stable on-disk artifact so a 2.x run and a 3.0 run can be diffed
 * cell-by-cell after the fact.
 *
 * The serialised schema is deliberately MINIMAL and secret-free:
 *
 *   - file paths are stored RELATIVE to `projectRoot` (no absolute `/Users/...`
 *     leakage — see {@link RunnerAgnosticReport.files});
 *   - the cell metadata (sdkLine/platform) is baked INTO the body, not only the
 *     filename, so a moved artifact never loses its provenance;
 *   - NO relay wss / scheme / TOTP / relayUrl fields exist in the schema at all
 *     (enforced by the type + this comment) — error strings are the matcher
 *     message only, inherited from rpc.ts which already strips expression/value.
 *
 * react-free — depends only on the type-level `RelayRunReport` and `node:fs` /
 * `node:path`. Safe to bundle without pulling the chii/cloudflared graph.

/**
 * Writes the serialised report to `<dir>/<sdkLine>.<platform>.json`, creating
 * `dir` if needed. Returns the absolute path(s) written.
 *
 * The cell-suffixed filename keeps 2.x and 3.0 (and per-platform) runs as
 * distinct artifacts in the same directory; the same cell metadata is also baked
 * into the body so a renamed/moved file still carries its provenance.
 *
 * Manual-run provenance (devtools#741): when `report.files` contains ANY
 * `mode: 'manual'` entry (i.e. this run included `--manual-blocking` files),
 * the manual-tagged files are written to a SEPARATE
 * `<dir>/<sdkLine>.<platform>.manual.json` artifact instead of the standard
 * one — the standard `<sdkLine>.<platform>.json` filename is reserved for the
 * regular (unattended) files only, so a manual run's presence never mutates
 * what the unattended-baseline filename means.
 *
 * Stub-blocking provenance (devtools#740, DT-2): `mode: 'stubbed'` files are
 * written to a THIRD, separate `<dir>/<sdkLine>.<platform>.stubbed.json`
 * artifact — never merged into the standard file (it is unattended, like the
 * standard file, so a naive filename split could conflate the two) and never
 * merged into `.manual.json` (it did NOT have a human present). Its body is
 * ALSO stamped `cell.bridgeStub: true` — the mandatory HYBRID-cell provenance
 * from the issue: a stubbed result must never be silently mixed into the
 * real-device baseline report.
 *
 * If ALL files in the run are regular, only the standard artifact is written
 * (today's behavior, unchanged). Any combination of the three modes present
 * in a single run writes ONLY the corresponding artifacts — each is additive,
 * never replacing another.
 *
 * SECRET-HANDLING: the written body contains no relay/secret fields (the schema
 * has none). `dir`/`projectRoot` are local filesystem paths, never logged here.
 *
 * @param report - The core relay run report.
 * @param dir    - Output directory (created recursively if missing).
 * @param meta   - Cell axes + projectRoot.
 * @returns The absolute path(s) written, in order: standard first (if any
 *   regular files ran), then manual (if any manual files ran), then stubbed
 *   (if any stubbed files ran). At least one path is always returned when
 *   `report.files` is non-empty.
