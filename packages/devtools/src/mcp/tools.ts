/**
 * Debug-mode MCP tools (Phase 1–3 + safe-area probe).
 *
 * Read-only tools that normalize CDP / AIT data into `chrome-devtools-mcp`-
 * compatible shapes. The tools never touch a websocket or HTTP endpoint
 * directly — they read from an injected `CdpConnection` (CDP events/commands)
 * or `AitSource` (AIT.* domain), which is what makes them unit-testable with a
 * fake. No phone and no running dev server are needed in tests.
 *
 *   Phase 1 (CDP events):
 *     - `list_console_messages`  ← Runtime.consoleAPICalled
 *     - `list_network_requests`  ← Network.requestWillBeSent + responseReceived
 *     - `list_pages`             ← Chii relay target list + tunnel status
 *   Phase 2 (CDP commands):
 *     - `get_dom_document`       ← DOM.getDocument
 *     - `take_snapshot`          ← DOMSnapshot.captureSnapshot
 *     - `take_screenshot`        ← Page.captureScreenshot
 *     - `measure_safe_area`      ← Runtime.evaluate (safe-area probe)
 *   Phase 3 (AIT.* domain — CDP can't cover these):
 *     - `AIT.getSdkCallHistory`
 *     - `AIT.getMockState`
 *     - `AIT.getOperationalEnvironment`

/**
 * The JS probe injected via `Runtime.evaluate`. It reads:
 *   1. `env(safe-area-inset-*)` via a temporary element with padding set to
 *      those CSS env vars, then `getComputedStyle`.
 *   2. SDK insets via a priority chain so the SAME probe works on both relay
 *      (real device) and mock (devtools panel page):
 *        a. `window.__sdk.SafeAreaInsets.get()`  — dog-food bundle on real device.
 *        b. `window.__sdk.getSafeAreaInsets()`   — dog-food bundle (deprecated).
 *        c. `window.__ait.state.safeAreaInsets`  — devtools mock state (mock env).
 *      The probe records `sdkInsetsSource` = `'window.__sdk'` | `'window.__ait'`
 *      | `null`. If all paths fail the result carries `sdkInsetsError`.
 *   3. nav bar geometry: the SDK does not expose navBar height as a standalone
 *      API — `.ait-navbar` DOM height is read as a cross-check, and
 *      `navBarHeightSource` records where it came from.
 *   4. `innerWidth`, `innerHeight`, `devicePixelRatio`, `navigator.userAgent`.
 *
 * Returns a plain JSON-serialisable object so `returnByValue: true` works.
 *
 * NOTE: This expression is evaluated in the page context — on the real device
 * (relay) or on the mock panel page. It does not mutate any page state — the
 * temporary element is removed after reading. No secret or auth token is read
 * or returned.
 *
 * RFC #277 Tier C parity: the SAME probe string runs in both envs. Mock fidelity
 * comes from the panel's `applyViewport` / `computeSafeAreaInsets` correctly
 * setting `window.__ait.state.safeAreaInsets` (#275). When that is correct,
 * the cssEnv + sdkInsets pair returned here matches the relay's shape.
