/**
 * RFC 6238 TOTP implementation (Node.js, node:crypto only).
 *
 * External TOTP libraries (otplib, speakeasy, …) are intentionally NOT used
 * to keep the dependency surface minimal. This hand-roll is ~30 lines and
 * covers exactly what relay-side auth needs.
 *
 * Algorithm summary (RFC 6238 + RFC 4226):
 *   T  = floor(now / 30)          — 30-second time step counter
 *   K  = Buffer.from(secret, 'hex') — shared secret (raw bytes, hex-encoded)
 *   MAC = HMAC-SHA1(K, T as 8-byte big-endian uint64)
 *   offset = MAC[19] & 0x0f
 *   code = (MAC[offset..offset+4] & 0x7fffffff) % 10^6  — 6 digits
 *
 * Security note (keep this comment accurate):
 *   The baked-in secret in a dog-food build is extractable from the bundle by a
 *   determined reverse engineer. This mechanism raises the bar from
 *   "anyone with the URL" to "URL + bundle extraction + live TOTP calculation".
 *   Casual URL leaks (Slack paste, QR screenshot, shoulder-surfing) are
 *   blocked; deliberate reverse engineering is not. See threat model in
 *   src/mcp/chii-relay.ts and umbrella CLAUDE.md §4.
 *
 * SECRET-HANDLING: secret values and computed codes MUST NOT appear in any
 * log, error message, or string visible outside this module. Only boolean
 * pass/fail and reason enum values are safe to surface.

/**
 * Gate-specific skew for the relay WebSocket upgrade TOTP check.
 *
 * Rationale (why 6, not the RFC default of 1):
 *   - Each step is 30 s, so ±6 steps = past 6 steps accepted = 180–210 s of
 *     backwards acceptance. This means a code generated at issuance time is
 *     guaranteed valid for at least 3 minutes (180 s) after it was minted.
 *   - The real-world attach flow (QR issued on desktop → developer picks up
 *     phone → camera scan → launcher PWA loads → attach) routinely exceeds
 *     the 90 s window of the RFC default (skew=1), especially when the launcher
 *     PWA needs to reinstall or when the phone is not immediately at hand.
 *   - Expanding to ~3.5 min reachability is acceptable under the §4 threat
 *     model: the adversary we guard against is "someone who got the URL but
 *     does NOT have the secret". Without the secret they cannot compute a TOTP
 *     code regardless of the window size — security theater is explicitly
 *     forbidden by the project principle. An attacker WITH the secret (bundle
 *     extractor) is out of scope per CLAUDE.md §4.
 *
 * `verifyTotp`'s own default (skew=1) is deliberately left unchanged — it is
 * the RFC primitive. Only this relay-gate call site is widened.
