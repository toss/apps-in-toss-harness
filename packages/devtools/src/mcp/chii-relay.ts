/**
 * Boots the local Chii relay server.
 *
 * Chii (liriliri/chii) is a chobitsu-based CDP relay that lets non-Chrome
 * WebViews (iOS WKWebView / Android WebView — i.e. the Toss app) expose CDP.
 * The relay accepts a `target` websocket from the phone's injected `target.js`
 * and `client` websockets from CDP frontends (our MCP connection).
 *
 * Node-only: `chii` pulls in Koa + ws. Never bundled into the browser/in-app
 * entries.
 *
 * TOTP auth (relay-side, authoritative gate):
 *   When `verifyAuth` is provided, this module gates both inbound surfaces:
 *
 *   - HTTP 'request': a listener registered BEFORE `chii.start({server})`.
 *     Node's `http.Server` calls listeners in registration order; the first
 *     to call `res.end()` wins. Invalid auth → 401 + CORS header + a tiny
 *     JSON body (`{"error":"totp-rejected"}`) so a cross-origin script
 *     `fetch()` probe can READ the status (issue #478). Valid auth → return
 *     without side-effect (chii's Koa handler serves it).
 *
 *   - WS 'upgrade': after `chii.start()` has registered chii's own upgrade
 *     listener, we take over the upgrade chain (remove chii's listeners,
 *     re-dispatch manually). Invalid auth → accept-then-close: complete the
 *     handshake via a `noServer` WebSocketServer, then immediately close
 *     with code 4401 reason 'totp-rejected' (issue #478). A raw 401 +
 *     `socket.destroy()` only ever surfaced as close code 1006 in the
 *     browser — indistinguishable from a tunnel failure, which left the
 *     env-2 phone UI silent. The explicit dispatch (not listener ordering)
 *     is what keeps chii away from rejected sockets: accept-then-close
 *     leaves the socket alive, so an order-based early-return would let
 *     chii's later listener complete a SECOND handshake on the same socket
 *     — an auth bypass. Valid auth → forward to chii's captured listeners.
 *
 * TOTP code transports (issue #466) — two equivalent ways to carry the code:
 *   1. Query param `at=<code>` — used by the daemon-side `/client` connection
 *      (`chii-connection.ts` appends it; it holds the secret).
 *   2. Path prefix `/at/<code>/…` — used by the phone-side target. Chii's
 *      stock `target.js` derives its WS endpoint from the script `src`
 *      (`scriptEl.src.replace('target.js','')`), so the only way for the
 *      phone to carry a code is to embed it in the script URL path. The
 *      in-app attach injects `https://<host>/at/<code>/target.js`; both the
 *      script fetch and the derived `wss://<host>/at/<code>/target/<id>` WS
 *      dial then carry the prefix. The listeners below rewrite the prefix
 *      into the query form (`rewriteAtPathPrefix`) and MUTATE `req.url`
 *      before chii's own handlers (registered later) parse it — chii only
 *      ever sees the stripped URL.
 *
 * Threat model: "URL leak" — someone obtains the tunnel URL (Slack paste, QR
 *   screenshot, shoulder-surfing) but does not have the shared TOTP secret.
 *   Rotating 6-digit code makes the URL stale after 30 s.
 *   A determined attacker who extracts the secret from the dogfood bundle can
 *   still compute valid codes; that is out of scope (see umbrella CLAUDE.md §4).
 *
 * SECRET-HANDLING: The secret value and computed TOTP codes MUST NOT appear
 *   in any log, error message, or process output. `verifyAuth` is a black-box
 *   predicate from the caller's perspective; this module only forwards pass/fail.
