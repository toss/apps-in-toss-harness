/**
 * @ait-co/devtools debug-mode MCP server (stdio).
 *
 * Lets an AI coding agent attach to a running mini-app (real Toss WebView, or a
 * browser in dev mode) and read its console/network/DOM/screenshot over CDP plus
 * the AIT.* domain, without a human watching a phone. Transport is CDP-via-Chii:
 * a local Chii relay on an OS-assigned port (default 0) exposed through a
 * cloudflared quick tunnel; the phone attaches over the public wss URL.
 *
 *   AI host  --stdio-->  this server  --CDP client WS-->  Chii relay :<OS-port>
 *                                                          ^-- target WS -- phone
 *
 * Port 0 (default): the OS picks a free ephemeral port on every startup.
 * This prevents EADDRINUSE when a stale cloudflared child (orphaned after
 * SIGKILL, PPID 1) still holds a fixed port — which previously caused the MCP
 * handshake to fail with -32000. With port 0 any orphaned cloudflared is
 * harmless; the new relay always gets a fresh port.
 *
 * Best-effort child cleanup: SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP handlers call shutdown() to
 * stop cloudflared and the relay. uncaughtException/unhandledRejection also
 * call shutdown() before exit. SIGKILL cannot be intercepted by Node, so
 * cloudflared orphans from SIGKILL remain (port 0 makes them harmless). Users
 * can clean up manually: `pkill -f 'cloudflared.*trycloudflare'`.
 *
 * The tool layer reads from an injectable `CdpConnection` (CDP) and `AitSource`
 * (AIT.*), so every tool is unit-testable with a fake (no phone). This module
 * wires the live pieces (relay + tunnel + production connection); the phone
 * roundtrip is fully wired and pending only on-device acceptance.
 *
 * Dynamic tool registration (issue #208):
 * The server advertises `listChanged: true` so MCP clients can subscribe to
 * `notifications/tools/list_changed`. Before any page attaches, only bootstrap
 * tools (`start_attach`, `list_pages`) are listed. Once a target appears,
 * the full attach-dependent tool set is added and a `list_changed` notification
 * is sent — without requiring a session restart. `runDebugServer` and
 * `runLocalDebugServer` start a polling watcher that detects the 0→N target
 * transition and calls `server.sendToolListChanged()`.
 *
 * Note: `src/mcp/server.ts` (dev mode, HTTP mock-state) is NOT subject to this
 * model — it has no attach concept and always exposes the full tool surface.
 *
 * Node-only.

/**
 * Starts a polling watcher that detects target-set changes on

 * notification on the given server.
 *
 * The watcher polls every `intervalMs` (default 1 000 ms). On each tick it
 * calls `connection.refreshTargets?.()` first (fix #705-B) so that silent
 * disconnects (no CDP event, phone backgrounded / tunnel quiet) are picked up
 * before the signature is read. If `refreshTargets` throws — e.g. a transient
 * relay error — the tick is skipped entirely to avoid a spurious detach signal.
 *
 * After the refresh, it fires `server.sendToolListChanged()` + `onAttach()`
 * whenever the sorted target-id signature changes AND the new target set is
 * non-empty. This covers:
 *   - 0→N first attach
 *   - 1→1 target replacement (same count, different id — e.g. rescan)
 *   - N→M any change where the result is still non-empty
 *
 * Full detach (→ empty) fires `onDetach()` (fix #705-A) on the exact
 * non-empty→empty edge — i.e. only when the previous signature was non-empty.
 * This lets callers push an immediate "disconnected" SSE update to the
 * dashboard without waiting for the next periodic interval.
 *
 * The interval is **never cleared automatically** — it keeps running until
 * `stop()` is called during shutdown. This ensures that a target replacement
 * after the first attach is always detected.
 *
 * `onAttach` is called on every non-empty signature change (or immediately when
 * already attached). Use this to trigger side-effects such as pushing a fresh
 * SSE state to open dashboard tabs (issue #509). Both callbacks are optional;
 * omitting them preserves the previous behaviour exactly.
 *
 * SECRET-HANDLING: target `id`/`title`/`url` are not written to any log here.
 * Only an attach-detected stderr line is emitted (no target details).
 *
 * `server` is optional (devtools#772): the standalone test-runner path
 * (`test-runner/relay-factory.ts`) has no MCP `Server` instance to notify —
 * it only needs the `onAttach`/`onDetach` dashboard-push side effects. When
 * omitted, `sendToolListChanged()` is simply skipped; the signature-diff and
 * callback logic is byte-for-byte the same. Existing MCP daemon call sites
 * always pass a real `Server`, so their behavior is unchanged.
