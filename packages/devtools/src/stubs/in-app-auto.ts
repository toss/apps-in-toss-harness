/**
 * TRANSITION STUB — REMOVE IN 1.0.0.
 *
 * `@apps-in-toss/devtools/in-app/auto` moved to `@apps-in-toss/debug-console/auto` (#818).
 *
 * A side-effect import (`import '@apps-in-toss/devtools/in-app/auto';`) in a shipped
 * mini-app entry point. **Must never throw** — see `src/stubs/in-app.ts` for
 * why the in-app surface is the one place a throw would reach a real user.
 *
 * The pre-split entry self-gated on `?debug=1` + `?relay=` + DEV before doing
 * anything. This stub keeps the same gate before printing, so a normal
 * production load stays completely silent: someone opening the deployed app
 * has no debug intent and should see nothing in their console. The notice
 * appears only for the developer who actually asked for a debug session and is
 * therefore the person who needs to know the package moved.
