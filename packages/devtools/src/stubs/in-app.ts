/**
 * TRANSITION STUB — REMOVE IN 1.0.0.
 *
 * `@apps-in-toss/devtools/in-app` moved to `@apps-in-toss/debug-console` (#818).
 *
 * **This stub must never throw.** Unlike the `/mcp/*` and `/test-runner`
 * subpaths, the in-app attach surface is the one piece of the old debug
 * surface that legitimately ends up inside a shipped mini-app bundle. A
 * consumer who built and deployed against `@apps-in-toss/devtools@0.1.x` has this
 * import (or an unplugin-injected equivalent) sitting in production code; if
 * upgrading the package turned that import into a throw, their app would die
 * on a real user's phone over a developer-tools concern. So every export here
 * is an inert no-op that says its piece through `console.error` once and
 * returns the shape the old API returned.
 *
 * The surface below mirrors the pre-split `src/in-app/index.ts` exports so a
 * stale call site still type-checks and still runs; it simply does nothing.
