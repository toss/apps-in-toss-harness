/**
 * Project-local ephemeral URL store — WRITE/DELETE half (#424, relocated #818).
 *
 * Environment-2 ("AITC Sandbox PWA") cold-start needs two ephemeral URLs that
 * change on every run: the CDP relay's https base and the app tunnel's https
 * base. Rather than making the developer copy-paste them into env vars each
 * time, the dev server writes them to `<project>/.ait_urls` and the MCP daemon
 * (`@apps-in-toss/debugger`) discovers them from there.
 *
 * Why this module is here and not in `@apps-in-toss/debugger`: the writer IS the vite
 * dev-server plugin. `@apps-in-toss/debugger` owns the READ half only — its daemon
 * reads `.ait_urls` read-only and never writes it. Splitting the file that way
 * matches who is allowed to mutate it, and it keeps the write path available
 * when `@apps-in-toss/debugger` is not installed at all. The file format is the
 * contract between the two packages; changing it requires changing both sides.
 *
 * Kept deliberately minimal compared with the pre-split `src/mcp/relay-url-store.ts`:
 * the read path (`readRelayUrls`) moved out with the daemon, so only
 * {@link writeRelayUrls} and {@link deleteRelayUrls} remain.
 *
 * SECRET-HANDLING: `relayBaseUrl` and `tunnelBaseUrl` carry the tunnel host —
 * the same sensitivity class as the `.ait_relay` TOTP secret. The raw values,
 * partial values, and the resolved file path MUST NOT appear in any log, error
 * message, stdout, stderr, or assertion output here or at any call site. Only
 * boolean pass/fail signals are safe to surface. The file is written mode 0600.
