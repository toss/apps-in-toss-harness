/**
 * Optional-peer resolution gates for the debug surface (issue #817).
 *
 * The debug surface now ships as two SEPARATE packages, declared here as
 * OPTIONAL peerDependencies of `@apps-in-toss/devtools`:
 *
 *   - `@apps-in-toss/debugger`      — MCP daemon / test runner / dev-bridge. devDependency
 *                               or `npx` only; never part of an app bundle.
 *   - `@apps-in-toss/debug-console` — on-device attach + eruda console. The ONLY debug
 *                               package that can legitimately enter an app bundle.
 *
 * Neither may become a hard dependency. The overwhelming majority of consumers
 * use environment 1 only (browser + mock SDK + panel) and must install NOTHING
 * extra — that is the whole point of splitting the packages apart. So every
 * call site reaches them through the resolution gates below and degrades
 * gracefully when they are absent:
 *
 *   - env-2 CDP wiring (`tunnel.cdp`) → falls back to the plain screen-preview
 *     tunnel (no relay, no dashboard) and prints {@link INSTALL_HINT}.
 *   - in-app attach injection → the snippet is simply not injected, so the
 *     attach code is STRUCTURALLY ABSENT from the bundle rather than merely
 *     gated at runtime. This gate is the technical enforcement point of the
 *     debug surface's security scope: no `@apps-in-toss/debug-console` installed
 *     means no attach code can reach a bundle at all.
 *
 * The `import.meta.resolve` probe follows the `MOCK_PATH` precedent in
 * `./index.ts`: resolution is attempted once at plugin-load time and a failure
 * is a plain "not installed" signal, never an error.
 *
 * SECRET-HANDLING: nothing here touches a relay URL, tunnel host, TOTP secret
 * or code. The only strings emitted are fixed specifiers and the install hint.
