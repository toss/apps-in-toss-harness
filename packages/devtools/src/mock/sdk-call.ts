/**
 * SDK-call trace shape produced by the mock's `observe()` wrapper.
 *
 * These declarations used to live in `src/mcp/ait-source.ts` because the MCP
 * `AIT.getSdkCallHistory` tool was their only *consumer*. After the debug
 * surface moved to `@apps-in-toss/debugger` (#818) the producer — `observe()`
 * writing into `aitState.sdkCallLog` — is the only side left in this package,
 * so the types live next to it.
 *
 * They stay part of the public `@apps-in-toss/devtools/mock` surface (re-exported
 * by `state.ts`): a consumer reading `window.__ait.sdkCallLog` needs the shape,
 * and any out-of-process reader (the MCP daemon among them) types against the
 * same declarations.
