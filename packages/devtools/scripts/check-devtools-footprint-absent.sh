# Build-time absence guard for the devtools runtime footprint (issue #818).
#
# `@apps-in-toss/devtools` is a devDependency whose contribution to a production
# mini-app bundle must be ZERO BYTES. The unplugin runs host-side during the
# build (SDK aliasing, panel injection, tunnel wiring) and the panel is
# consumed behind `import.meta.env.DEV`; a production build must therefore
# dead-code-eliminate the entire mock + panel graph. This script is the
# mechanical proof of that claim.
#
# It replaces the four guards the split (#818) removed along with the surfaces
# they watched — check-debug-surface-absent.sh, check-mcp-react-free.sh,
# check-test-runner-dist.sh and check-dashboard-html-fresh.sh all guarded code
# that now lives in `@apps-in-toss/debugger` / `@apps-in-toss/debug-console`. What is left
# in this package is exactly mock + panel + unplugin, so what is left to guard
# is exactly their footprint.
#
# Three checks:
#   1. This package's own `dist/` carries none of the MOVED implementation.
#      The transition stubs (src/stubs/) deliberately keep the old subpaths
#      alive, so their presence is expected; what must not come back is the
#      implementation behind them — the relay/attach internals, the eruda
#      console, the MCP SDK.
#   2. RELEASE fixture build (minified, `import.meta.env.DEV` false) contains
#      no devtools runtime sentinels — proves DCE works for a real consumer.
#   3. POSITIVE CONTROL: FORCED fixture build (AIT_FOOTPRINT_FORCE=1) DOES
#      contain them — proves the grep can see devtools code when it is present,
#      so a green check 2 means something. Without this, a fixture that
#      silently stopped importing anything would pass check 2 forever.
#
# IMPORTANT: the release build MUST be minified. With minify off, a dead
# `if(false){ … }` husk survives as text and its identifier strings match the
# grep — a false positive. Vite production builds minify by default; do not
# pass --minify=false here.

# name `eruda` in prose ("the eruda overlay moved with the attach surface"),
# while the in-app stub still exports `mountEruda`/`unmountEruda` so a stale
# call site keeps type-checking. A bare-word grep fails on correct code; only
# an actual `import 'eruda'` is a regression.
