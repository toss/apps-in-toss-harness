// Pure letterbox-detection logic for the launcher PWA (#469) — no DOM, no

//
// Background (#469 forensics, iPhone 16e Simulator / iOS 26.5; #475 real-device
// CDP measurements, iOS 26): in standalone (home-screen) mode, iOS can
// mis-size the web view while anchoring it at the TOP. From inside the page the
// signature is:
//
//   window.innerHeight ≈ screen.height − statusBar   (shortfall)
//   display-mode: standalone
//
// Geometry model (CORRECTED 2026-06-13, #561 — supersedes the earlier
// "missing strip is OUTSIDE the window, OS-painted" theory):
//
//   The window is the FULL screen height — real-device measurement of an
//   attached letterboxed iframe reported outerHeight 844 === screen.height,
//   screenY 0, standalone true. It is NOT an OS-level letterbox.
//
//   What is mis-sized is the WebKit top-level VIEWPORT: layout + content paint
//   + hit-testing all clip at screen.height − statusBar (≈797 on a 844 screen).
//   An IntersectionObserver sentinel ladder (sentinels at bottom 0…110px inside
//   the framed page) found the clip boundary exactly at y≈797: every sentinel at
//   or below the boundary reported isIntersecting:false, the first above it
//   reported true. The bottom ~47pt band receives only the canvas background
//   (black) — no content paints there and no touch lands there.
//
//   Consequence: the #527 px expansion (forcing the root container to
//   screen.height px) does NOT paint into that band — a fixed box does not
//   contribute to document scroll overflow, so the band stays unreachable. Worse,
//   stretching the iframe to screen.height − envTop − bar (743) while the real
//   viewport is 797 CLIPS the mini-app's own bottom ~47px of content (its bottom
//   buttons silently vanish). The pre-#527 formula (calc(100% − env(top) − bar),
//   100% resolving against the real ≈797 ICB → iframe ≈696) leaves the dead band
//   visible but loses no content. The earlier "Web Inspector height override
//   paints into the band (2026-06-12)" observation is now believed to be an
//   artifact of the Inspector attach itself altering viewport state — it is
//   irreconcilable with today's IO-ladder measurement.
//
//   #561 response: the px correction is no longer applied on faith. Launcher.tsx
//   applies it, then VERIFIES it at runtime (verifyLetterboxCorrection() below —
//   a bottom sentinel + top-level IntersectionObserver). If the sentinel is
//   clipped, the layout falls back to the honest calc()/100% formula, bridge
//   insets are re-sent with letterboxCorrected=false (bottom 0), and the toast
//   states the limit honestly instead of claiming a fix.
//
// Discriminator (#479 rule, restored in #491): the canonical letterbox
// signature under black-translucent is:
//
//   standalone && portrait && shortfall >= 24 && safeAreaTop > 0
//
// Case analysis (real-device CDP, iOS 18.7, 2026-06-11):
//
//   |케이스                                   | shortfall | top | bottom | 판정  |
//   |------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|--------|-------|
//   | 신메타(black-translucent) healthy         |     0     | 47  |  34    | false |
//   | 신메타 letterbox (오늘 실측)               |    47     | 47  |  34*   | true  |
//   | 구메타(stale web clip) healthy below-sb   |   47–59   |  0  |  34    | false |
//   | 구메타 letterbox (#479 실측)               |    47     | 47  |   ?    | true  |
//   | SE-class healthy (20pt status bar)        |    20     | 20  |   0    | false |
//
//   * phantom bottom 34 — real-device iOS 18.7, 2026-06-11: the letterbox
//     window reports bottom 34 even though it stops above the home indicator.
//     bottom carries NO signal in either state; the discriminator ignores it.
//
// Why bottom is excluded (#491 correction of #487):
//   #487 assumed that under black-translucent a letterboxed window would
//   collapse safeAreaBottom to 0 (window stops above the home indicator).
//   Real-device measurement (iOS 18.7, 2026-06-11) refutes this: the
//   letterboxed window reported bottom 34 (the same "phantom" value that #475
//   observed on a different window state). Bottom is a phantom in BOTH states,
//   so it carries no discriminating signal. The #479 top-inset rule is
//   reinstated: under black-translucent a healthy window has no shortfall, so
//   the `safeAreaTop > 0` guard never fires against a healthy window —
//   #487's false-positive concern is dissolved by the shortfall requirement.
//
// Configurations that still do NOT match:
//   - normal browser tab           → not standalone.
//   - standalone, edge-to-edge     → innerHeight === screen.height (shortfall 0).
//   - black-translucent healthy    → shortfall 0 → false (top>0 never fires).
//   - home-button devices (20pt)   → shortfall 20 < threshold 24 → false.
//   - stale web clip (legacy meta) → top 0 (status bar below window, not under)
//                                    → false even with shortfall 47–59.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Cold-start env() stale-0 workaround (#536)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// On iOS standalone (home-screen web clip) WebKit has a known defect where
// env(safe-area-inset-*) returns 0 immediately after a cold start and only
// settles to the real value after orientationchange (WebKit #274773). The
// measurement is done via a throwaway element's computed padding — the stale
// reading means safeAreaTop=0 at t=0 ms even though the window IS under the
// status bar. This causes detectLetterbox() to miss the event: shortfall ≥ 24
// fires, but the safeAreaTop>0 guard blocks it.
//
// The fix: the Launcher polls env() at multiple checkpoints after mount
// (100/300/500/1000 ms) and re-evaluates the letterbox verdict at each point.
// Once safeAreaTop leaves 0 (real value arrived) the first non-stale snapshot
// is used and subsequent polls are cancelled. The poll times are deliberately
// sparse — the WebKit bug usually settles within the first second, and the
// timer overhead is negligible (four short-lived closures, no DOM mutation).
//
// This module exposes two pure functions so the polling logic is unit-testable
// with fake timers under vitest (jsdom never has real env() values anyway):
//
//   scheduleSafeAreaTopPolls(read, onSettled, delays, timers)
//     — schedules successive reads; calls onSettled once at the first non-zero
//       reading or after all delays have fired (even if still zero).
//
//   detectLetterboxWithReason(metrics)
//     — extends detectLetterbox() with a `reason` field that names the first
//       gate condition that blocked detection (or 'detected').
//
// The Launcher wires these in its viewport-measure effect: the initial
// readViewportMetrics() snapshot is passed to the verdict immediately, and the
// polls update the snapshot as env() settles.

/**
 * Possible reasons that detectLetterboxWithReason() returns detected=false.
 * Useful for diagnostics: "shortfall 47, top 0" reads as 'safeAreaTopZero',
