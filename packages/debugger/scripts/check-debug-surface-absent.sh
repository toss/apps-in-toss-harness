# Build-time absence guard for the in-app debug surface (issue #647).
#
# The in-app debug surface — Chii target.js injection AND the eruda console it
# pulls in — must be PHYSICALLY ABSENT (zero bytes) from a release consumer
# bundle, not merely gated at runtime. A consumer guards its
# `import('@ait-co/devtools/in-app')` with `if (__DEBUG_BUILD__) { … }`; a
# release build defines `__DEBUG_BUILD__: false`, and the bundler
# dead-code-eliminates the whole in-app graph. This script is the mechanical
# proof of that, plus a check that eruda never leaks into the MCP daemon bundles.
#
# Three checks:
#   1. MCP daemon bundles (dist/mcp/*.js) contain no `eruda` — those run via
#      `npx -p @ait-co/debugger debugger` and must never pull a browser console
#      into the install/runtime graph (mirrors check-mcp-react-free.sh).
#   2. RELEASE fixture build (AIT_DEBUG_BUILD unset, NODE_ENV=production,
#      minify ON) contains no debug-surface sentinels — proves DCE works.
#   3. POSITIVE CONTROL: DEBUG fixture build (AIT_DEBUG_BUILD=1) DOES contain
#      them — proves the toggle is alive (guards against a dead grep that would
#      pass even if the build guard silently stopped including anything).
#
# The fixture used for checks 2/3 is the dedicated minimal release consumer in
# scripts/debug-absence-fixture/ — NOT the e2e panel fixture. The panel fixture
# aliases @apps-in-toss/web-framework back at the mock (a self-referential
# alias) and keeps a live dynamic in-app import for chunking reasons; DCE-ing
# that import there duplicates the mock graph. The minimal fixture isolates the
# only thing under test: the if(__DEBUG_BUILD__) guard on a real consumer's
# dynamic in-app import.
#
# IMPORTANT: the release build MUST be minified. With minify off, a dead
# `if(false){ … }` husk survives as text and its identifier strings (e.g.
# `eruda`) match the grep — a false positive. Vite production builds minify by
# default; do not pass --minify=false here.
